I have worked as a business analysist for three years and started working as data analysist for one recent year during my study at VUW. I hold a Master's degree in International Business Management (University of Westminster, the UK) and a PhD degree in Information system (VUW). </p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica"> During the time working as a business analysist as well as a post-grad student at VUW, I have sharpened my data analysing skills with different types of projects (e.g., survey data on individual opinions on online recommendation systems; or business consulting project with Pizza Pomodoro - the best pizza of Wellington 2018; 2021). I am trained and highly experienced in questionnaire design and can work efficiently with Qualtrics in data collection.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica">If you are insterested in my work, please reach out to me by email or via the section below </p>
